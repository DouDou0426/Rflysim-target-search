# Rflysim-target-search
This hardware-in-the-loop simulation experiment was deployed and implemented on a distributed UAV swarm simulation platform. A Pixhawk flight control computer and PX4 autopilot were adopted to control a swarm consisting of 7 UAVs. Two types of experimental scenarios were designed:
Multi-UAV target search scenario in an obstacle-ridden environment;
Multi-UAV target search scenario with mid-mission UAV crash caused by equipment failure.
The simulation of the mission environment was completed in a virtual complex environment built on the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). Specifically, the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAVs had a ground speed of 20 m/s and a minimum turning radius of 100 m.
